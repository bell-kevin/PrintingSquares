# PrintingSquares
 Create a project for exercise #10 on p. 159 in the book (Introduction to Programming with Java A Problem Solving Approach Second Edition by John Dean and Raymond Dean), which prints out the square of an input number in a loop. Without changing the loop type, modify the code to incorporate an IF statement to prevent printout when the input equals the sentinel value of zero.

First, create the project that contains the code fragment in the book. Run it – you should notice right away that there is no prompt telling the user to type the number to be squared. Add that line of code, asking for the number, and have the user type the input on the same line to the right of the question. Also add a line before the loop starts that prints the project name and your name. Run the program and give it 3 numbers to work with, then 0 to quit. Notice that even though that input of 0 meant the program should end, it prints out the square of zero – it processed the number before quitting. Take a screenshot of the results.

Second, modify the code by adding an IF statement to prevent it from printing anything when the sentinel value of zero is entered. Run the program again, give it 3 numbers, then 0 to quit, and take a screenshot of the results.

Ch 4 Printing Squars

 

Pay careful attention to the rubric for this assignment. Even if not specifically mentioned in the assignment, you are responsible for the following:

    Use descriptive names for all variables
    Add comments describing the use or meaning of variables
    Do NOT include literal values in any calculations, always use variables
    Always include a header in the output with a descriptive title and your name
    If asking for input, make sure the user types on the same line as the question
    Where sample sessions are provided, output from your project must match it

Note that you must use correct formatting in the code -- appropriate indentation is most important. You can use Shift-Alt-F to have NetBeans automatically format the code correctly. If the formatting is incorrect, it will be returned to you for changes with a grade of zero.

Submission: the specified screenshots and the root folder for the project

Note: You need to submit the whole project for these assignments. In File Explorer, go to the location where you created the project. There will be a folder with the name of your project -- that is the root folder of the project.  If you submit the root folder of the project, the instructor can run it on a different machine to grade it. If you don't submit the proper folder, it won't run on another machine, and the assignment will be marked with a zero.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
